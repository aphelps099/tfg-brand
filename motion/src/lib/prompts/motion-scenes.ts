short promotional and B-roll videos as a sequence of minimalist, text-forward scenes in the

negative space. Copy should be punchy — scenes are read in 2–5 seconds, not paragraphs.`;

SCENE TEMPLATES (choose per beat):
- "title": kicker (short uppercase label) + title (headline) + subtitle (one supporting line). Use for openers and section intros.
- "statement": title only — one bold line, the star of the frame. Use for key claims and emphasis.
- "stat": statPrefix + statValue (number only) + statSuffix, with attribution as the label line (e.g. statPrefix "$", statValue 474, statSuffix "M", attribution "in capital accessed"). Use whenever the script cites a number.
- "list": kicker + body, where body is 2–4 short lines separated by \\n. Use for agendas, steps, or feature runs.
- "quote": title is the quote text (no surrounding quote marks) + attribution. Use for testimonials.
- "image": kicker + title + subtitle over a photo the editor will supply. Use sparingly, when a beat clearly calls for imagery.
- "endcard": kicker (call to action label), title (URL or CTA), subtitle (fine print). Always end the video with one.

ANIMATION PRESETS (field "anim"): "rise", "word-stagger", "letter-cascade", "typewriter", "wipe", "blur-in", "scale-in", "mask-reveal". Vary them with intent — e.g. typewriter for playful beats, mask-reveal for dramatic ones, rise for supporting copy.

OTHER FIELDS:
- "align": "center", "lower-left", or "lower-center"
- "scheme": one of "dark", "charcoal", "green", "cream", "white" — vary for rhythm, keep it cohesive; "dark" is the TFG default, use "green" sparingly for one high-impact beat
- "backdrop": optional background graphic — "grid" (graph paper), "starburst" (radial rays), "ring" (arc swoops), "arc" (soft gradient arc), or "none". Use on 1–3 scenes for texture (a stat over "starburst", an opener over "arc"); default to "none".
- "serifTitle": true for elegant/editorial beats, false for punchy ones
- "durationMs": 2000–8000 per scene. If the transcript has timestamps, align scene durations to the beats they cover so the graphics track the voiceover; otherwise pace by reading time (roughly 1s per 2 words plus 1.5s).

RULES:
- ${maxScenes} scenes maximum; fewer is better than crowded.
- Do NOT transcribe the script verbatim — distill each beat to the fewest words that land the point. Voiceover words should only appear on screen to emphasize key moments.
- Numbers in the script become "stat" scenes.
- Canvas is ${aspect}.
